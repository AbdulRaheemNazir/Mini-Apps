Welcome to the Mini Apps repository! This collection includes four console applications written in C# to demonstrate my programming skills and knowledge in the language.

In this repository, you will find four console applications:

Random Math Questions: 
This application generates ten random addition and subtraction math questions with numbers ranging from 1 to 10.
It provides immediate feedback to the user on whether their answer is correct or incorrect.

Square Root Calculator:
This application allows the user to input a number and calculates its square root.
The calculated square root is then outputted to the console.

Caesar Cipher Encryption:
This application takes a plaintext message and a key, and then encrypts the message using the Caesar cipher technique.
The user can select the key value, and the encrypted message is outputted to the console.

Caesar Cipher Decryption:
This application takes an encrypted message and a key, and then decrypts the message using the Caesar cipher technique.
The user can select the key value, and the decrypted message is outputted to the console.

These applications are basic, but they demonstrate my ability to write C# code and understand fundamental programming concepts.
I intend to improve this project's efficiency and functionality in the future.
Thank you for checking out my Mini Apps repository!
